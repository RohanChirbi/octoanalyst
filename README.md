# OctoAnalyst

An AI engine for deeply analyzing stock entities listed on NSE. Tranditional LLMs give generic analysis and more often without the relevant context. This project aims to use relevant data and custom set of rules for accurate research.

This project is written in Javascript and Python along with libraries such as React and Node.js!
