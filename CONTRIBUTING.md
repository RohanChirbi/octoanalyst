## The Workflow
 - The user can pick listed company ticker and the workflow proceeds to fetch pdfs of annual reports of the company from nse servers and parses it into text.
 - For analysis of the report, the user creates a rules file(currently harcoded) where they mention the respective topics they want to analyse the selected company on.
 - For fetching data from the pdf, a py script gives each page a topic name by trying to find the largest bit of text on the page and the uses a vector search to fetch the respective pages according to the topic names mentioned in rules.
 - With each topic name and relevant content fetched, the same is sent to ai to analyse and summarize each topic info
 - This processed data is finally displayed as a mindmap.

### Different components in use
 - Frontend:
   - React for frontend logic and shadcn for simple UI.
 - Backend:
   - Node.js and Express for API layer
   - Python files for parsing and semantic search
